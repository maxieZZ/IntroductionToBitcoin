# Basic Block-Chain Implementation in Python

The following code is a command line program in Python that illustrate four main features of an implemented blockchain. These features included simplified elements of blockchain techniques such as wallet generation, mining for a nonce value, digital signatures and public private key encryption, transactions, and block validation. A more detailed list of features is outlined below:

- Hashing and mining with a given difficulty
- Wallet generation and validation with public private key encryption
- Transaction verification with RSA encryption
- Block generation and verification
- Simulated System Attacks...
	+ Wallet/Coin Theft
	+ Block Modification
	+ Double Spending
	+ Majority Attack


# Dependencies

Works with ```Python 3.6```

Python Crypto Library (use either pip or brew to install pycrypto on mac)

# How to run the code

1. Use the terminal to navigate into the "code" folder and execute the following command

>> Python3 block.py

2. The above command will start the program by taking the user to a main menu section where they may select from the four menu options listed. After selecting an option, the simulated output will be displayed and the user may choose to either quit by pressing 0 or return to the main menu by pressing 1.
